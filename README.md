# CSCI_E29_Final_Project

The purpose of this project is to use deeplearning to explore stastical features for PGA tour players. Since
their introduction to the PGA tour in 2011, they have quickly become the strandard statistic to quantify the 
performance of various aspects of a player's game (e.g., driving, putting, bunker play, etc.).
